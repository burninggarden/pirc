/**
 * From RFC1459:
 *
 * 4.1.2 Nick message
 *
 *       Command: NICK
 *    Parameters: <nickname> [ <hopcount> ]
 *
 *    NICK message is used to give user a nickname or change the previous
 *    one.  The <hopcount> parameter is only used by servers to indicate
 *    how far away a nick is from its home server.  A local connection has
 *    a hopcount of 0.  If supplied by a client, it must be ignored.
 *
 *    If a NICK message arrives at a server which already knows about an
 *    identical nickname for another client, a nickname collision occurs.
 *    As a result of a nickname collision, all instances of the nickname
 *    are removed from the server's database, and a KILL command is issued
 *    to remove the nickname from all other server's database. If the NICK
 *    message causing the collision was a nickname change, then the
 *    original (old) nick must be removed as well.
 *
 *    If the server recieves an identical NICK from a client which is
 *    directly connected, it may issue an ERR_NICKCOLLISION to the local
 *    client, drop the NICK command, and not generate any kills.
 *
 *    Numeric Replies:
 *
 *            ERR_NONICKNAMEGIVEN             ERR_ERRONEUSNICKNAME
 *            ERR_NICKNAMEINUSE               ERR_NICKCOLLISION
 *
 *    Example:
 *
 *    NICK Wiz                        ; Introducing new nick "Wiz".
 *
 *    :WiZ NICK Kilroy                ; WiZ changed his nickname to Kilroy.
