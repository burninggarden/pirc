              ":You have been marked as being away"

         - These replies are used with the AWAY command (if
           allowed).  RPL_AWAY is sent to any client sending a
           PRIVMSG to a client which is away.  RPL_AWAY is only
           sent by the server to which the client is connected.
           Replies RPL_UNAWAY and RPL_NOWAWAY are sent when the
           client removes and sets an AWAY message.
