       366    RPL_ENDOFNAMES
              "<channel> :End of NAMES list"

         - To reply to a NAMES message, a reply pair consisting
           of RPL_NAMREPLY and RPL_ENDOFNAMES is sent by the
           server back to the client.  If there is no channel
           found as in the query, then only RPL_ENDOFNAMES is
           returned.  The exception to this is when a NAMES
           message is sent with no parameters and all visible
           channels and contents are sent back in a series of
           RPL_NAMEREPLY messages with a RPL_ENDOFNAMES to mark
           the end.
